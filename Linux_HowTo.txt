Tested on Ubuntu 18.04

1. Create an executable jar
 - invoke the following command 'mvn clean package' - an executable jar file (license-manager-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar) will be created in the target folder
 
2. Create a user on which the service is going to be run
 - sudo useradd licenseManager
 - sudo passwd licenseManager

3. Place the generated jar file in the following directory /opt/services
 - NOTE: this location is used in license-manager.service script which you use in a moment
 
4. Assign proper rights to the jar file
 - sudo chown licenseManager:licenseManager license-manager-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
 - sudo chmod 500 license-manager-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

5. copy the file "license-manager.service" to /etc/systemd/system
 - the file is available in the project's sources on the same level as the file you are reading now

6. Enable and start the application
 - sudo systemctl enable license-manager
 - sudo systemctl start license-manager

7. Removing service
 - sudo systemctl stop license-manager
 - sudo systemctl disable license-manager
 - sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/license-manager
 - sudo systemctl daemon-reload
 # for cleanup all units with failed status
 - sudo systemctl reset-failed
